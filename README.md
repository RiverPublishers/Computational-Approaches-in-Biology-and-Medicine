## 🧬 Computational Approaches in Biology and Medicine  
### Official Code Repository – River Publishers

This GitHub repository hosts all code, datasets, and computational resources associated with the **Computational Approaches in Biology and Medicine** series — the **first River Publishers series** to provide a formally indexed, executable code companion fully integrated into an open science workflow.

Led by **Editor-in-Chief Andrea Tangherloni (Bocconi University, Italy)**, the series focuses on modern computational, statistical, and machine learning methods applied to biological systems, medical data, and digital health.

## 📁 Repository Structure and Chapter Mapping

Each book chapter that includes programming examples is accompanied by a **fully executable Jupyter notebook**, designed to closely mirror the structure and content of the corresponding chapter.

├── Chapter3_notebook.ipynb   # Sample Statistics and Hypothesis Testing
├── Chapter4_notebook.ipynb   # Machine Learning Methods
├── Chapter5_notebook.ipynb   # Integrated Example and Model Evaluation
└── README.md

- Notebooks contain **only the code presented in the book**, with minimal additions required for execution (e.g., dataset loading).
- Each notebook includes **Markdown commentary** explaining the purpose, assumptions, and interpretation of the code.
- Sections and subsections appear **only where executable code exists**, avoiding duplication of purely conceptual material from the book.

## ▶️ How to Use the Notebooks

The notebooks are intended as **didactic companions**, not black-box analysis pipelines.

Readers can:
- Run each notebook top-to-bottom to reproduce the examples,
- Modify parameters or datasets to explore alternative scenarios,
- Reuse individual code cells as templates for their own biomedical analyses.

All examples rely on standard Python scientific libraries, including:
- `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

Where relevant, random seeds are fixed to ensure reproducibility.

## 🔁 Reproducibility and Best Practices

This repository follows established best practices for reproducible computational research:

- Deterministic random seeds are used where applicable,
- Validation strategies (e.g., cross-validation, held-out test sets) are explicitly demonstrated,
- Synthetic or publicly available datasets are employed to ensure accessibility,
- Statistical assumptions and methodological limitations are discussed alongside results.

The goal is to promote transparent, interpretable, and reliable computational workflows aligned with modern biomedical research standards.

## 💬 Feedback and Community Interaction

Each code snippet in the book references this repository.

Readers are encouraged to:
- Open **GitHub issues** to report bugs, inconsistencies, or unclear explanations,
- Suggest improvements or extensions to existing notebooks,
- Use the notebooks for teaching, learning, or as a starting point for research projects.

This repository is intended as a **living companion** to the published volumes and may evolve based on community feedback.
